    <p style="padding: 100px; color: black;">Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that have made it one of the 
        most sought after tourist destinations in Asia. A long shoreline with serene beaches, 
        tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife, are
         just a few of the wonders.Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary
          destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places. In 2023, Kerala was listed
           at the 13th spot in The New York Times' 
         annual list of places to visit and was the only tourist destination listed from India.
